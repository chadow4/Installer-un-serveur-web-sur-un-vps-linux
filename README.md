# INSTALL LAMP SERVER ON LINUX

Hello everyone, here are the 3 files to use to install a web server on your vps linux :

- commands.txt ==> all the commands necessary to install the web server on your machine

- connexion.php ==> it allows to check if the connection between the database and the website is effective

- info.php ==> check that php is well installed and obtain all the information from it

That's it :)
